## Libraries and Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Project is written in the R language using RStudio.
REquires the R CRAN libraries:
 - rvest
 - xml2
 - sqldf
 - jsonlite

## Project Description<a name="motivation"></a>

Obtains historic financial data and stores in SQLite database in ~/data/USFinance.db

Two targets are Alphavantage (Get your own API key if you want to use this), and macrotrends.

There is also a regression learner included in the project; however this file is not maintained.  I have superseded it with the web-based app (see Finance-Regerssion-Analyzer repository).
